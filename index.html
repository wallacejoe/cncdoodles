          About Us
        </h2>
        <p class="home-paragraph-1">
          We are a small family breeder located in Mesa, Arizona. We breed
          adorable doodle puppies. In 2020, we adopted a beautiful AKC registered
          English Cream Golden Retriever puppy and a handsome AKC Standard
          Brindle Poodle. As they grew and matured, we researched the possibilty
          of beginning the process of training and breeding well rounded family dogs.
          We subsequently decided to breed them with each other to create the
          popular designer breed dog known as a Goldendoodle. In 2022, we decided
          to breed other doodle mixes in addition to Goldendoodles. We will be adding
          Newfypoos and Bernedoodles to our breeding program in early 2024.

              Teddybear Goldendoodles
            </h2>
            <p class="home-paragraph-2">
              Goldendoodles are a popular doodle breed that is achieved by breeding
              a Golden Retriever with a Poodle. This mix can involve a Standard,
              Mini, or Toy Poodle. When a Poodle is bred with an English Cream
              Golden Retriever, rather than a standard Golden Retriever, the
              resulting Goldendoodle is known as a Teddybear Goldendoodle or
              English Cream Goldendoodle. These Goldendoodles are known for
              their blocky conformation that gives them the classic teddybear
              look that many individuals are very fond of. English Cream Golden
              Retrievers also have a 23% less chance of getting cancer and a
              slightly longer average lifespan than a normal Golden Retriever.
              These dogs are very
              intelligent, with Golden Retrievers and Poodles both being known
              as very smart and loving dog breeds. However, both dog breeds are
              very friendly, so they generally do not make good watch dogs.
              Goldendoodles generally live around 10 to 15 years. Their biggest
              draw is their hypoallergenic coat. They inherit this coat from
              their Poodle parent and will shed very little or not at all. This
              is perfect for people with allergies to dog fur. Goldendoodles
              also have what is known as hybrid vigor. Since they are bred from
              two completely unrelated dogs, they tend to be healthier than a
              strictly purebred dog that may be bred from closely related
              parents. Currently, Cookies and Cream Doodles only breeds standard
              sized F1 Teddybear Goldendoodles. Our Doodles will grow to be between
              45 and 60 pounds. We plan to add F1B Teddybear Goldendoodles to our
              breeding program in the future.

            <p class="home-paragraph-4">
              Newfypoos are a unique doodle breed that is achieved by breeding
              a Newfoundland with a Poodle. This mix generally only involves a
              Standard Poodle due to a Newfoundland's size. Newfypoos are very
              large dogs that inherit the intelligence of the Poodle parent
              and the loving nature of the Newfoundland.
              The Poodle genes will also lessen the amount of drooling the
              Newfypoos do, resulting in mostly dry mouth puppies. Newfypoos
              generally live for 8 to 12 years. Like Goldendoodles, their biggest
              draw is their hypoallergenic coat. They inherit this coat from
              their Poodle parent and will shed very little or not at all. This
              is perfect for people with allergies to dog fur. Newfypoos will
              also have what is known as hybrid vigor. Since they are bred from
