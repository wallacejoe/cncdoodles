          <p class="question">
            How much do you sell each puppy for?
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            We generally sell the puppies for around $3,000. This price is
            subject to change for puppies that have certain colors or coat types.
          </p>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <p class="question">
            Do you provide discounts if a family purchases multiple puppies?
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            No. It is very difficult to care for more than one puppy at a time,
            so we require full price for all puppies in order to encourage
            families to think carefully about adopting more than one puppy at a
            time.

          <p class="question">
            Do you early spay/neuter your puppies?
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            We do not. We believe that dogs need the hormones in order to grow
            correctly. We recommend that Goldendoodle puppies be spayed/neutered around
            the time that they turn one year. Newfypoos and Bernedoodles should not be
            fixed until they are at least a year and a half.

          <p class="question">
            Do you offer breeding rights?
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            Yes. We charge $500 extra per puppy for breeding rights.

          <p class="question">
            Do you ship your puppies?
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            We are happy to discuss potential shipping or travel arrangements!

          <p class="question">
            Do you remove dewclaws and dock tails?
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            We do not remove dewclaws. We have observed our dogs in day-to-day
            life and fully believe that dewclaws are necessary in order to allow
            them to function. We do not dock tails because we like the long,
            full tails of our dogs.
          </p>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <p class="question">
            What vaccines and dewormings do puppies receive before going home?
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            All puppies receive their first shots around 7 weeks. They are also
            dewormed every two weeks starting at 2 weeks.
          </p>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <p class="question">
            Where are the puppies raised?
          </p>
          <p class="answer">
            The puppies are born and raised in our home, and we handle and love
            them from day one!
